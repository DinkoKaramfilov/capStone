Hello my name is Dinko Karamfilov, my capstone project will be a bartender website that will use a rapberrypi 
to create the drink in real life. This project will be a single page application that is has a dynamic and interactive center section in the middle. my audience is potential Interviewers and mentors, as well as users who need some mixologist information. I want to make a web application that lets users select the unlimited potential  of mixed drinks, they would be able to design their own drink on my site and then have the raspberry pi make the drink right in front of the user. My application will be rich in variables in which they are both portreid as a design on the site as well as in person. the content would be heavy with details and even some history of liquor or spirits. 

Some idea of the looks of index page: https://wireframe.cc/dsTfMS
